## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** GraphQl, Apollo, MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Javascript, CSS

Developed using the MERN stack this project showcases my skills in crafting scalable web applications. Utilizing GraphQL for efficient data queries and management, Apollo for seamless client-server interaction, and added CSS for styling, this app ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Optimizations
In pursuit of scalability, I've employed well-designed schemas and an MVC architecture. This not only enhances the app's performance but also lays a foundation for easy integration of additional features in the future. The separation of queries and mutations ensures organized code, making maintenance and expansion a breeze.

I'll soon be adding Google Auth, and sorting features for customers and projects.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this project has been an exciting learning journey. Emphasizing the importance of good app structure, I discovered the power of GraphQL and Apollo for enhanced data handling. The MVC architecture proved pivotal in maintaining clarity and scalability. These insights will undoubtedly shape my future projects as I continue to explore and expand my skills.
