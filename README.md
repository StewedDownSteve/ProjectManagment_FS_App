## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** GraphQl, Apollo, MongoDB, Express, React, Node, Javascript, CSS

Developed using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js—this project showcases my skills in crafting scalable web applications. Utilizing GraphQL for efficient data queries and management, Apollo for seamless client-server interaction, and CSS for styling, this app ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Optimizations
In pursuit of scalability, I've employed well-designed schemas and an MVC architecture. This not only enhances the app's performance but also lays a foundation for easy integration of additional features in the future. The separation of queries and mutations ensures organized code, making maintenance and expansion a breeze.

I'll soon be adding Google Auth, and sorting features for customers and projects.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this project has been an exciting learning journey. Emphasizing the importance of good app structure, I discovered the power of GraphQL and Apollo for enhanced data handling. The MVC architecture proved pivotal in maintaining clarity and scalability. These insights will undoubtedly shape my future projects as I continue to explore and expand my skills.
